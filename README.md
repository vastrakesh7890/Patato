# Patato Programming Language 🍠

A minimal, low-level programming language more efficient than C and more powerful than Rust – built completely from scratch, without using any existing compiler or interpreter.

## Goals
- Zero dependency
- Smooth, low-level execution
- Self-hosted compiler & virtual machine
- Built in Assembly and custom logic

## Stage 0
First "Hello, Patato" program written in pure x86_64 Assembly using Linux syscalls.
